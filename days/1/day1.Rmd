```{r}
input = readr::read_table("input.txt", col_names="depth", col_types="i")
head(input)
```


count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement

```{r}
library(dplyr)
input %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    increases_over_previous = sum(diff(depth) > 0))
```



# Part 2

consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window.

count the number of times the sum of measurements in this sliding window increases from the previous sum

```{r}
with_window= input %>%
  mutate(sliding_3_sum = depth + slider::slide_sum(depth, before=2, complete=T),
         sum_diff = coalesce(c(0,diff(sliding_3_sum)),0))
with_window
```

```{r}
with_window %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    increases_over_previous_window = sum(sum_diff > 0))
```
